Each folder may contain:
-  Concept practice
-  Interview questions
-  LeetCode/GFG solutions
-  Custom logic with main method

##  How to Compile and Run Java Files

###  If there's **no `package` declaration**:
Just go into the folder and run:
```bash
javac FileName.java
java FileName
````

Example:

```bash
cd StackP
javac ValidParanthesis.java
java ValidParanthesis
```

---

###  If there's a `package` declaration (e.g. `package StackP.PracticeQ;`):

####  Folder structure must match the package:

For this line:

```java
package StackP.PracticeQ;
```

The file should be placed like:

```
Java-Prep/StackP/PracticeQ/FileName.java
```

Then from root (`Java-Prep`), compile and run:

```bash
javac StackP/PracticeQ/FileName.java
java StackP.PracticeQ.FileName
```

###  Important Notes on Packages:

* Don’t run `java FileName` if package is declared.
* Only one `public class` per file.
* Use package structure to avoid name clashes and for better project organization.
